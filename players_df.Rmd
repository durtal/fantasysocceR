#### Usage
```{r, eval=FALSE}
players_df(player_list, add_vars = NULL)
```

#### Arguments

param | details
------|--------
player_list | the list of players returned by [collect_ff](collect_ff.html)
add_vars | extra variables to add if desired

#### Example use
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# convert list into dataframe
new_players_df <- players_df(player_list = player_list)

# convert list into dataframe and add a couple of variables, points per game
new_players_df <- players_df(player_list = player_list, add_vars = c("points_per_game"))
```
