Description: Datasets for players and teams in the fantasy football (soccer)
    game (fantasy.premierleague.com).  The game data updates frequently as
    users 'manage' their teams, so datasets will quickly expire.  I will try
    to update datasets regularly, but functions are available to help collect
    up-to-date data in the same/similar format to the existing datasets.
