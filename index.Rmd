Here you will find details about the R package **fantasysocceR**, which contains datasets and functions for playing and interacting with the official fantasy football game ([fantasy.premierleague.com](http://fantasy.premierleague.com)).  The package is hosted on github, you can find it [here](https://github.com/durtal/fantasysocceR), there is also a short post introducing the package [here](http://durtal.github.io/blog/r-package-fantasysocceR.html).

To install and load the package (devtools must be installed first):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "fantasysocceR", user = "durtal")
```

### Datasets
There are 3 stable datasets that come with the package, these datasets were updated after the 2014/15 Premier League season was completed.  The datasets are:

* [**players**](players.html)
* [**pastseasons**](pastseasons.html)
* [**season201415**](season201415.html)

### Functions

There are a few functions included in the package, one of which collects up-to-date fantasy football data, the function is [`collect_ff`](collect_ff.html).  This function returns a list of players and their performance data.  This list can then be converted to neat dataframes using some of the packages other functions, these are [`players_df`](players_df.html), [`pastseasons_df`](pastseasons_df.html) and [`currentseasons_df`](currentseasons_df.html).  To see these functions in action see [here](using_functions.html).

Another function, [`team_pal`](team_pal.html) provides a simple palette for the teams in the 2014/15 season, this palette can then be used in conjunction with `ggplot2` to create some nice plots.
